# Epsilon-Calibration Experiment

Calibrates the annual-unit (§2) search epsilons — the values Borg's
ε-dominance archive uses (`config.get_epsilons()` →
`src/objectives_ensemble._ANNUAL_REGISTRY_SPEC`) — on the campaign search
measures. An epsilon must (i) resolve *meaningful* policy differences in
interpretable native units, (ii) not resolve *sampling noise* of the ensemble
estimator, and (iii) keep the archive (and therefore the reported Pareto set)
at a tractable cardinality. The published precedent gives the signal-scale
rule (archive resolution ≈ signal scale, Reed et al. 2013) and the
noise-exclusion requirement (epsilon precision set to suppress simulation
noise, Kasprzyk et al. 2013); this experiment measures both floors directly,
per design, and sweeps the archive-size consequence.

Scripts: `scripts/supplemental/epsilon_calibration_{run,figures}.py`;
launcher `workflow/supplemental/epsilon_calibration.sh` (one sbatch job per
design, design selected by `NYCOPT_ENV_FILE` — `workflow/envs/eps_calib_*.env`);
settings in `supplemental_config.py` (`EPS_*`). Outputs under
`outputs/supplemental/epsilon_calibration/`.

## Setup

- **Designs**: each campaign design is calibrated on its own search ensemble —
  `historic` (N = 1 over the trace's consecutive water-year units),
  `fixed_probabilistic` and `hazard_filling_stationary` (N = 100 × L = 10,
  draw 0) — because the search objectives are computed under different
  measures across designs and the archive lives inside each search.
- **Policies**: `EPS_N_POLICIES` = 512 random policies drawn **uniform on the
  constraint-feasible region** (rejection against the two formal Borg
  constraints — pure DV arithmetic; realized acceptance rate persisted as QC),
  plus the FFMP baseline (id −1). Feasible-only sampling matches the archive's
  population: constraint-dominance keeps infeasible vectors out of the
  archive, so infeasible spread must not inflate the signal scale.
- **Evaluation**: each policy runs once per design through the same batched
  path Borg workers use (`run_simulation_ensemble_batched`, campaign
  realization batch), storing the full stage-(i) cube
  `(n_dv × n_real × n_obj × n_units)` for the **entire annual-unit registry**
  (active 7 + the optional NJ 8th + the flood-P99 diagnostic), so the pending
  operator/8th-objective decisions read from the same artifact. Pooling the
  cube and applying the unit operator reproduces the search scalar exactly.

## Per-objective quantities (figures script; post-hoc, no re-simulation)

1. **Signal scale** — IQR of the natural-unit search scalar across the
   feasible random policies; `eps_signal = IQR / 10`.
2. **Noise floor** — bootstrap SD of the unit-operator estimator under
   resampling of the realization axis with replacement
   (`EPS_BOOTSTRAP_B` = 1000, one shared index draw per design); summarized
   as the median (and p90) across policies. The single-trace historic design
   resamples the unit-year axis instead — an i.i.d. approximation that
   understates noise under serial dependence (disclosed, not corrected, per
   the project convention).
3. **Granularity floor** — the failure-frequency objectives take values on a
   1/(N·units) lattice; an epsilon below that step cannot merge adjacent
   attainable values.
4. **Recommendation** — `eps_rec = ceil_to_clean_step(max(1, 2, 3))` in native
   units, with the binding floor and a plain-language interpretation recorded
   per objective.
5. **Archive-size sweep** — ε-nondominated archive size (Borg box convention,
   `src.sensitivity_common.epsilon_nondominated`) of the evaluated policies
   for the recommended vector × `EPS_SCALE_GRID` and for the current registry
   vector, over the active objective subset. Random feasible policies
   under-fill a converged front, so the absolute sizes are a proxy; the
   scaling trend is the decision signal.

## Campaign vector

The Borg problem and the MOEAFramework JARs carry ONE epsilon set for all
designs, so the campaign value per objective is the clean-rounded maximum of
the raw requirement across designs (no design's archive may resolve below its
own noise floor); the binding design is recorded, and a >4× cross-design
spread in the raw requirement triggers a review warning. Adopt the combined
table (`tables/epsilon_recommendation_*.csv`) into `_ANNUAL_REGISTRY_SPEC`
**before** JAR generation (step 00), updating the provenance comment there.

## Outputs

- `cube/unit_cube_{formulation}_{design}_seed{S}_n{N}.h5` — per-unit metric
  cube + DV vectors + acceptance-rate QC.
- `tables/epsilon_diagnostics_{…}.csv` (per design), `archive_sweep_{…}.csv`
  (per design), `epsilon_recommendation_{…}.csv` (combined).
- `figures/eps_ladder_{design}` (F1: floors vs current vs recommended, log
  axis), `scalar_distributions_{design}` (F3: signal spread with epsilon
  widths), `archive_size_vs_scale` (F2, combined).
